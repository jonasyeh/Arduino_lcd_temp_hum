# Arduino_lcd_temp_hum
With the code, you can not only obtain the humidity and temperature with DHT11 but send the data to lcd screen(I2C) and an Android phone!!

The .ino file is for the arduino, while the .aia file is for the MIT app inventor.

Meanwhile, the .pptx file contains some info of my project. It's in traditional Chinese, btw.

Feel free to take a look!
